2.12.4 (2009-10-29)
-------------------

  `__iter__` as well as `__getitem__` (this fixes

2.12.1 (2009-04-15)
-------------------

- Update for iteration proxying: The proxy for `__iter__` must not rely on the

  `__getitem__` (this fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope2/+bug/360761).

2.12 (2009-01-25)
